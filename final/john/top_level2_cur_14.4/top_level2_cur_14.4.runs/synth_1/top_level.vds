WARNING: [Netlist 29-345] The value of SIM_DEVICE on instance 'vga_comp/sel_rep' of type 'RAMB18E1' is 'VIRTEX6'; it is being changed to match the current FPGA architecture, '7SERIES'. For functional simulation to match hardware behavior, the value of SIM_DEVICE should be changed in the source netlist or constraint file.
