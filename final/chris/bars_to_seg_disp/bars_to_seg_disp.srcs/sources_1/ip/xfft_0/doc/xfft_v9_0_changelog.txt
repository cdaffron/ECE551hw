2014.2:
 * Version 9.0 (Rev. 4)
 * No changes

2014.1:
 * Version 9.0 (Rev. 4)
 * Removed duplicate VHDL process from Radix-2 architecture which caused multiple driver synthesis errors with Vivado 2014.1
 * C models for Windows are compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio 2012
 * Rephrasing code in file r22_twos_comp_mux.vhd. Functionality is unchanged.
 * Rephrasing code in file xfft_v9_0_viv.vhd. Functionality is unchanged.
 * Internal device family name change, no functional changes
 * Netlists created by write_verilog and write_vhdl are IEEE P1735 encrypted, with keys for supported simulators so that netlist simulation can still be done
 * Enable third party synthesis tools to read encrypted netlists (but not source HDL)
 * c_compare_carry_structure, c_compare_eq_ne, c_mux_bit_v12_0_viv and c_shift_ram_v12_0_legacy vhd files rephrased to eliminate warnings. Functionality unaffected.
 * Support for Virtex Ultrascale devices at Pre-Production Status

2013.4:
 * Version 9.0 (Rev. 3)
 * Change to end of simulation message in demonstration testbench.
 * Support for Kintex Ultrascale devices at Pre-Production Status

2013.3:
 * Version 9.0 (Rev. 2)
 * Cosmetic GUI changes to table header row, no change in functionality
 * Internal standardization in source file delivery, does not change behavior
 * Support for Automotive Artix-7, Automotive Zynq, Defense Grade Artix-7, Defense Grade Zynq and Lower Power Artix-7 devices at Production Status
 * Added default constraints for out of context flow
 * Added support for Cadence IES and Synopsys VCS simulators
 * Optimized support for UltraScale devices
 * Fixed demonstration testbench elaboration errors - see Xilinx Answer 56322.
 * Removed C model dependency on stlport (STL Portability) library; C model now uses STL built into the compiler
 * Windows C model DLLs are statically linked to the Windows C run-time (CRT) library, to remove the runtime dependency on MSVCRT90.dll, which can cause problems when using the C model in a Windows compiler other than Visual Studio 2008

2013.2:
 * Version 9.0 (Rev. 1)
 * Support for Series 7 devices at Production status
 * Beta support for future devices
 * Removing support for Defense Grade Low Power Artix7
 * Fix for AR53087

2013.1:
 * Version 9.0
 * Native Vivado Release
 * There have been no functional or interface changes to this IP.  The version number has changed to support unique versioning in Vivado starting with 2013.1.
